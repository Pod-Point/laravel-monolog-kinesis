A simple package to forward Laravel application logs to a Kinesis stream.

## Installation

Require the package with composer:

Laravel < 6.0
```bash
composer require pod-point/laravel-monolog-kinesis:^2.0
```

Laravel 6.0+
```bash
composer require pod-point/laravel-monolog-kinesis:^3.0
```

## Usage

Simply use our `kinesis` driver on any of your channels within your `config/logging.php`:

```php
'kinesis' => [
    'driver' => 'kinesis',
    'stream' => env('LOGGING_STREAM'), // don't forget to define the Kinesis stream name
    'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    'level' => 'info' // default level is debug
],
```

*Note*: If you are using the log channel `stack`, ensure you add the `kinesis` channel.

## Permissions
